## Library description
ExternData is a utility library to access data stored in CSV, INI, JSON, MATLAB MAT, Excel XLS/XLSX or XML files.
The aim of this library is to provide access from Modelica simulation tools to data sets for convenient model initialization and parametrization.

### Main features
* Read support of file formats
  * [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
  * [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file)
  * [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
  * [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) MAT of version v4, v6, v7 and v7.3
  * [Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel) [XLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel#Binary) and [XLSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel#XML_Spreadsheet)
  * [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)
* Pure C (and not C++) code for external functions and objects
* Cross-platform (Windows and Linux)
* Tested in [Dymola](http://www.dynasim.se) and [SimulationX](http://simulationx.com), with dependency on the [Modelica Standard Library](https://github.com/modelica/Modelica) v3.2.2.

All data I/O access is implemented using external Modelica functions.

### Known issue with OpenModelica
The example models of the library are known to fail with [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org). However, as a workaround the functions can be rewritten to make them working in OpenModelica by replacing their short class definitions and their appropriate function calls. For example, the short class definition `ExternData.XMLFile.getReal`
```mo
final function getReal = Functions.XML.getReal(xml=xml)
  "Get scalar Real value from XML file";
```
can be rewritten as function
```mo
function __OpenModelica_getReal "Get scalar Real value from XML file"
  extends Modelica.Icons.Function;
  input String fileName="" "File where external data is stored";
  input String varName "Key";
  output Real y "Real value";
  protected
    ExternData.Types.ExternXMLFile xml = ExternData.Types.ExternXMLFile(fileName) "External XML file object";
  algorithm
    y := ExternData.Functions.XML.getReal(xml=xml, varName=varName);
  annotation(Inline=false);
end __OpenModelica_getReal;
```
taking the file name as explicit argument for the external object.
